    "\n",
    "**vehicleSeq** : takes an integer value, an unique identification number for each vehicle.  \n",
    "**fourWheeler** : takes a boolean value to determine if the parked car is a four wheeler or not.   \n",
    "**parkedFor** : takes an integer value, denotes number of hours the car is parked for.   \n",
    "**valetParking** : takes a boolean value, denotes whether the owner used Valet Parking or not.  \n",

    "*ParkingLot* class initialises a Python dictionary to store the list of ParkedVehicle objects. It has 5 methods as shown below:  \n",
    "1. **add_to_parking_lot** adds a new car to the parking lot by storing the ParkedVehicle object in the parked_vehicles dictionary.  \n",
    "2. **parking_charge** calculates the total cost of the parking for the entire duration a vehicle object has been parked. It followes the follwing rule while calculating the cost:  \n",
    "if a car is a Four Wheeler, then the rate is 50 INR      \n",
    "if a car is a Two Wheerler, then the rate is 30 INR.  \n",
    "if the owner used a valet to park his car, it adds 10 INR to the base price, otherwise the base price is the final price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **get_parking_catalog** returns the dictionary which contains all the lot numbers of the parked cars.    \n",
    "4. **change_parked_status** changes the status of the vehicle object from True to False and vice versa. It takes the vehicle object as a parameter.    \n",
    "5. **get_parked_status** returns a boolean value denoting whether the vehicle is parked or not. It takes the vehicle object as a parameter.   \n"
